# HTTP CLI

A terminal-native HTTP client — like Postman, but lives in your terminal.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielAlmeidaFlores/GabrielAlmeidaFlores/main/assets/HTTP-CLI/http-cli.gif"/>

`http-cli` is a fully interactive TUI HTTP testing tool built in Go. Create, organize, and execute HTTP requests without leaving the terminal. Vim-style navigation, fully config-driven keybindings and colors, persistent storage, and contextual hints make it a complete replacement for GUI HTTP clients in keyboard-driven workflows.

- Export request as cURL — copy the current request as a ready-to-run curl command
- Import Postman collections — load a Postman v2.1 JSON export
- Export Postman collections — save all requests as a Postman-compatible file
- Open response in external editor — view the response body in your configured editor
- Open any cell in external editor — edit large values (headers, body) outside the TUI
- Persistent storage — requests saved automatically in SQLite
- All keybindings come from `configs/config.json` — no hardcoded keys in source
- All colors come from `configs/config.json` — fully themeable

## Importing from cURL

Press `I` in the Requests panel. Paste any `curl` command, including multi-line commands with `\` continuation. Supported flags: `-X`, `-H`, `-d`, `--data-raw`, `--data-binary`, `-b`/`--cookie`, `-u`, `-A`/`--user-agent`, `-L`, and more.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"secret"}'
```

---

## Exporting cURL

Press `E` in the Requests panel to see the current request as a curl command. Press `y` to copy it to the clipboard.

---

## Postman Collections

- **Import** (`P`) — provide a path to a Postman v2.1 JSON export file. All requests are added to your collection.
- **Export** (`X`) — provide a filename. All requests are written as a Postman-compatible JSON file you can import into Postman or share.

---

## External Editor

The external editor is used in two places:

- **Cell edit** — press `ctrl+o` inside the cell edit modal to open the cell value in your editor
- **Response body** — press `v` in the response panel to open the full response body in your editor

The editor is configured in `configs/config.json`:

```json
"external_editor": "vi"
```

Set it to any editor command: `"nano"`, `"nvim"`, `"code --wait"`, `"$EDITOR"`, etc. The content is written to a temporary file which is deleted after the editor closes.

---

## Configuration

Everything is in `configs/config.json`. There are no hardcoded keys or colors in the source code.

### Changing a keybinding

Find the action in the relevant panel section and change `"keys"`:

```json
"request_list": {
  "new_request": {
    "keys": ["a"],
    "description": "New request",
    "category": "Requests",
    "visible": true
  }
}
```

Multiple keys are supported: `"keys": ["n", "ctrl+n"]`

Set `"visible": false` to hide a shortcut from the hints bar without disabling it.

### Theme colors

All colors are under `"ui" → "theme"`. Values are hex colors:

```json
"theme": {
  "primary": "#00d7ff",
  "success": "#00d700",
  "error": "#d70000",
  "method_get": "#00d700",
  "method_post": "#d7d700",
  "method_delete": "#d70000"
}
```

See [`configs/config.json`](configs/config.json) for the full list of theme fields and all available panels and actions.
